                    <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931</b> 
                    to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on
                     Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu.
                      His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;[9]
                       his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.[10][11][12][13] His father owned a ferry
                        that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now 
                        uninhabited Dhanushkodi.[14][15] Kalam was the youngest of four brothers 
                        and one sister in his family.[16][17][18] His ancestors had been wealthy 
                        Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts 
                        of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and
                         Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women.
